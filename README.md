# Retail-Sales-Analysis

## Project Overview
**Project Title:** Retail Sales Analysis  

This project focuses on exploring, cleaning, and analyzing a superstore's retail sales data. It involves setting up a retail sales database, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), and using SQL queries to address key business questions.

## Project Objectives
1. **Retail Sales Database Setup** â€“ Establish and populate a database using the provided sales data.  
2. **Data Cleaning** â€“ Detect and eliminate records containing missing or null values to ensure data quality.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Conduct an initial analysis to gain insights into the dataset's structure and key trends.  
4. **Business Analysis** â€“ Utilize SQL queries to address critical business questions and extract meaningful insights from the sales data.  

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains transaction records from a retail store, including details such as:  
- **Transaction ID** â€“ Unique identifier for each sale.  
- **Sale Date & Time** â€“ Timestamp of the transaction.  
- **Customer ID** â€“ Unique identifier for each customer.  
- **Demographics** â€“ Customer gender and age.  
- **Product Category** â€“ Classification of purchased products.  
- **Quantity & Pricing** â€“ Quantity sold, price per unit, and cost of goods sold (COGS).  
- **Total Sale** â€“ Final amount spent on each transaction.  

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup
- **Database Creation:** The project begins with setting up a database named `db_Retail_Sales`.  
- **Table Creation:** A table called `Retail_Sales` is created to store sales data.  

```sql
CREATE DATABASE db_Retail_Sales;

-- CREATE TABLE
IF OBJECT_ID('Retail_Sales', 'U') IS NOT NULL
    DROP TABLE Retail_Sales;

CREATE TABLE Retail_Sales (
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,
    gender VARCHAR(15),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(20),
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);
```

### 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning
  - **Record Count:** Determine the total number of records in the dataset.  
  - **Customer Count:** Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset.  
  - **Category Count:** Identify all unique product categories in the dataset.  
  - **Null Value Check:** Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.  

```sql
-- Record Count: Determine the total number of records in the dataset:

SELECT COUNT (*) 
FROM Retail_Sales;

-- Customer Count: Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
FROM Retail_Sales;

-- Category Count: Identify all unique product categories in the dataset:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT category)
FROM Retail_Sales;

-- Null Value Check: Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data:

SELECT *
FROM Retail_Sales
WHERE transactions_id IS null OR sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR gender IS NULL
	OR category IS NULL OR quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL OR total_sale IS NULL;
```

### 3. Key Business Insights

1. SQL query to Retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Retail_Sales
WHERE category = 'Clothing' 
	AND quantity >= 4
	AND sale_date BETWEEN '2022-11-01' AND '2022-11-30'
```
2. SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM Retail_Sales
WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';
```
3. SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year:

```sql
WITH MonthlySales AS (
    SELECT YEAR(sale_date) AS Year, 
        MONTH(sale_date) AS Month, 
        AVG(total_sale) AS Average_Sales
    FROM Retail_Sales
    GROUP BY YEAR(sale_date), 
        MONTH(sale_date) 
		),

RankedSales AS (
    SELECT Year, 
        Month, 
        Average_Sales,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Year ORDER BY Average_Sales DESC) AS Rank
    FROM 
        MonthlySales
		)
SELECT Year, 
       Month, 
    Average_Sales AS Best_Selling_Month_Average
FROM RankedSales
WHERE Rank = 1
ORDER BY Year, Month;
```

4. SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.:

```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(*) Total_orders, SUM(total_sale) Total_sales
FROM Retail_Sales
GROUP BY category;
```

5. SQL query to create each shift and number of orders (Example Morning <12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17):
```sql
SELECT 
    Time_of_Day, 
    COUNT(*) AS number_of_orders
FROM ( SELECT *,
        CASE
            WHEN DATEPART(HOUR, sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
            WHEN DATEPART(HOUR, sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
            ELSE 'Evening'
        END AS Time_of_Day
    FROM Retail_Sales
) AS Subquery
GROUP BY Time_of_Day;
```
6. SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category:
```sql
SELECT category, AVG(age) Average_age
FROM Retail_Sales
WHERE category = 'Beauty'
GROUP BY category
```

7. SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM Retail_Sales
WHERE total_sale > 1000
```
8. SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category.:

```sql
SELECT gender, category, COUNT(*) Total_tranactions
FROM Retail_Sales
GROUP BY gender, category
ORDER BY gender, category;
```
9. SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales:

```sql
SELECT TOP 5
		customer_id, SUM (total_sale) Total_Sales
FROM Retail_Sales
GROUP BY customer_id 
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC;
```
10. SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT (COUNT(customer_id)) customer_count, category
FROM Retail_Sales
GROUP BY category
```

## Findings & Insights
