## Project Overview
**Project Title:** Retail Sales Analysis  

This project focuses on exploring, cleaning, and analyzing a superstore's retail sales data. It involves setting up a retail sales database, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), and using SQL queries to address key business questions.

## Technology Stack
- **Data Preparation & Loading** - Microsoft Excel
- **DBMS:** PostgreSQL 
- **Query Language:** SQL
- **SQL Queries**: DDL, DML, Aggregations, Joins, Subqueries, Window Functions
- **Data Visualizations**: Powerbi (Future Work)

### Data Source
- The dataset used for this project consists of all sales transaction made by the Retail company. 
- Dataset was downloaded from [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com)

## Project Objectives
1. **Database Setup** ‚Äì Establish and populate a database using the provided sales data.
2. **Data Cleaning** ‚Äì Detect and eliminate records containing missing or null values to ensure data quality.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
4. **Key Business Insights** ‚Äì Conduct an initial analysis to gain insights into the dataset's structure and key trends. Utilize SQL queries to address critical business questions and extract meaningful insights from the sales data.  
5. **Business Findings and Reccommendations** ‚Äì Provide Business recommendations using insights & trends gotten from the sales data.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains transaction records from a retail store, including details such as:  
- **Transaction ID** ‚Äì Unique identifier for each sale.  
- **Sale Date & Time** ‚Äì Timestamp of the transaction.  
- **Customer ID** ‚Äì Unique identifier for each customer.  
- **Demographics** ‚Äì Customer gender and age.  
- **Product Category** ‚Äì Classification of purchased products.  
- **Quantity & Pricing** ‚Äì Quantity sold, price per unit, and cost of goods sold (COGS).

## Project Structure

### 1. Data Preparation (Excel): 
- Data understanding, exploration, data loading, data importing.
- Check dataset structure using Column Headers & Data Types
- Standardizing Data Formats

### 2. Database Setup
- **Database Creation:** The project begins with setting up a database named `db_Retail_Sales`.  
- **Table Creation:** A table called `Retail_Sales` is created to store sales data.  

```sql
CREATE DATABASE db_Retail_Sales;

-- CREATE TABLE
IF OBJECT_ID('Retail_Sales', 'U') IS NOT NULL
    DROP TABLE Retail_Sales;

CREATE TABLE Retail_Sales (
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,
    gender VARCHAR(15),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(20),
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);
```
### 3. Data Exploration & Cleaning
  - **Record Count:** Determine the total number of records in the dataset.  
  - **Customer Count:** Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset.  
  - **Category Count:** Identify all unique product categories in the dataset.  
  - **Null Value Check:** Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.  

```sql
-- Record Count: Determine the total number of records in the dataset:

SELECT COUNT (*) 
FROM Retail_Sales;

-- Customer Count: Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
FROM Retail_Sales;

-- Category Count: Identify all unique product categories in the dataset:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT category)
FROM Retail_Sales;

-- Null Value Check: Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data:

SELECT *
FROM Retail_Sales
WHERE transactions_id IS null OR sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR gender IS NULL
	OR category IS NULL OR quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL OR total_sale IS NULL;
```

### 4. Key Business Insights

1. SQL query to Retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Retail_Sales
WHERE category = 'Clothing' 
	AND quantity >= 4
	AND sale_date BETWEEN '2022-11-01' AND '2022-11-30'
```
2. SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM Retail_Sales
WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';
```
3. SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year:

```sql
WITH MonthlySales AS (
    SELECT YEAR(sale_date) AS Year, 
        MONTH(sale_date) AS Month, 
        AVG(total_sale) AS Average_Sales
    FROM Retail_Sales
    GROUP BY YEAR(sale_date), 
        MONTH(sale_date) 
		),

RankedSales AS (
    SELECT Year, 
        Month, 
        Average_Sales,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Year ORDER BY Average_Sales DESC) AS Rank
    FROM 
        MonthlySales
		)
SELECT Year, 
       Month, 
    Average_Sales AS Best_Selling_Month_Average
FROM RankedSales
WHERE Rank = 1
ORDER BY Year, Month;
```

4. SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.:

```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(*) Total_orders, SUM(total_sale) Total_sales
FROM Retail_Sales
GROUP BY category;
```

5. SQL query to create each shift and number of orders (Example Morning <12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17):
```sql
SELECT 
    Time_of_Day, 
    COUNT(*) AS number_of_orders
FROM ( SELECT *,
        CASE
            WHEN DATEPART(HOUR, sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
            WHEN DATEPART(HOUR, sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
            ELSE 'Evening'
        END AS Time_of_Day
    FROM Retail_Sales
) AS Subquery
GROUP BY Time_of_Day;
```
6. SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category:
```sql
SELECT category, AVG(age) Average_age
FROM Retail_Sales
WHERE category = 'Beauty'
GROUP BY category
```

7. SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM Retail_Sales
WHERE total_sale > 1000
```
8. SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category.:

```sql
SELECT gender, category, COUNT(*) Total_tranactions
FROM Retail_Sales
GROUP BY gender, category
ORDER BY gender, category;
```
9. SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales:

```sql
SELECT TOP 5
		customer_id, SUM (total_sale) Total_Sales
FROM Retail_Sales
GROUP BY customer_id 
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC;
```
10. SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT (COUNT(customer_id)) customer_count, category
FROM Retail_Sales
GROUP BY category
```

## 5. Findings & Insights
